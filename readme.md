Marth's Website Things
======================
Building a website using Laravel just to learn stuff. Hopefully this works.

Notes to self:
- Nested comments need to work.
- E-mailing from the server needs to work.
- Need to support creating tags from post creation.
- Need an admin site for personal use and management. Stuff to include:
	- creation of categories
	- comment moderation
	- viewing logs
- Database seeding.
- Need to implement deletion for most models.
